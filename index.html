<p>FitMate takes the hassle out of finding a running partner by connecting local runners with opportunities to meet, train, or race. With the mobile app, all users must do is input preferences such as age, availability, and skill level. FitMate does the rest - identifying potential matches so that finding a workout companion is quick and convenient.</p>

<p>By partnering with local race organizers and groups, FitMate allows runners to easily seek new opportunities. Runners can then register directly through FitMate and coordinate training sessions with others in their area. FitMate users are able to achieve new goals, and race organizers see increased participation.</p>
