  "body": "###What is FitMate?\r\n\r\nFitMate takes the hassle out of finding a running partner by connecting local runners with opportunities to meet, train, or race. With the mobile app, all users must do is input preferences such as age, availability, and skill level. FitMate does the rest - identifying potential matches so that finding a workout companion is quick and convenient.\r\n\r\nBy partnering with local race organizers and groups, FitMate allows runners to easily seek new opportunities. Runners can then register directly through FitMate and coordinate training sessions with others in their area. FitMate users are able to achieve new goals, and race organizers see increased participation.\r\n\r\n![](http://kirabo.io/fitmate_2.png)\r\n\r\n###The FitMate Community\r\n\r\nFrom 5k to 40k, FitMate offers flexibility based to a diverse user base.\r\n\r\nFitMate hosts a community of eager and active runners seeking to enhance their workouts. FitMate encourages runners of all ages and skill levels to join and build upon this community to motivate their own experiences. \r\n\r\nRunners can use FitMate to expand their own networks by adding matches to their \"Favorites\" list. Connections can be used to find running partners quickly in the future, or organize training groups.\r\n\r\n###Run. Race. Challenge.\r\n\r\nConnected runners can run, race, or challenge each other through the app. Once being matched, the choice is totally up to the connected runners.\r\n\r\nFitMate makes it easy to communicate desired running goals and preferences. Once matched, runners can decide where and when to meet through FitMate - this makes discovering new runs and trails easy and versatile. \r\n\r\nRunners can also encourage their connections to join them on a run by sending them FitMate challenges. Challenges can be anything from a completing a training session, or seeing who has the best time in an upcoming 5k. The ability to search and register for races through FitMate makes challenges easy to create and fun to accept.\r\n\r\n![](http://kirabo.io/fitmate_1.jpg)\r\n\r\n###Who We Are\r\n\r\nTeam FitMate is made up of six students at Carnegie Mellon University with diverse backgrounds in computer science, design, psychology, business, and human-computer interaction.
